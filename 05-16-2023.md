## Input
---
The grid were stored in a file called `input.txt`, which contains the following lines:
```
XXXX.
X....
X..X.
.X.X.
XX.XX
```

## Solution Code
---
```python
file = open('input.txt', 'r')
size = 5
grid = []
grid_scores = []

def visualize(grid):
    for row in grid[1: -1]:
        for col in row[1: -1]:
            print(col, end='')
        print()
    print("-------------")

def apply_rule(center, top, bottom, left, right):
    neighbors = f"{top}{bottom}{left}{right}"

    if center == 'X':
        if neighbors.count('X') == 1:
            return 'X'
        else:
            return '.'
    else:
        if neighbors.count('X') == 1 or neighbors.count('X') == 2:
            return 'X'
        else:
            return '.'
        
def calculate_score(grid):
    score = 0
    for i, row in enumerate(grid[1:-1]):
        for j, ch in enumerate(row[1:-1]):
            if ch == 'X':
                score += (2 ** (i * size + j))
    
    return score

def observe(grid):
    grid_scores.append(calculate_score(grid))

    while True:
        grid_tmp = [ [ '.' for _ in range(size + 2)] for _ in range(size + 2) ]
        for x in range(1, size + 1):
            for y in range(1, size + 1):
                grid_tmp[x][y] = apply_rule(
                    grid[x][y],
                    grid[x-1][y],
                    grid[x+1][y],
                    grid[x][y-1],
                    grid[x][y+1])
        grid = [ [ ch for ch in row] for row in grid_tmp ]
        score = calculate_score(grid)
        if grid_scores.count(score) == 1:
            print(f'The lifeform score for the first layout that appears twice is {score}')
            break
        grid_scores.append(score)
        # visualize(grid)

grid.append([ '.' for _ in range(size + 2)])
for line in file:
    line = line.replace('\n', '')
    grid.append(['.'] + [*line] + ['.'])
grid.append([ '.' for _ in range(size + 2)])

# visualize(grid)
observe(grid)
file.close()
```

## Output
---
The result is:
```
The lifeform score for the first layout that appears twice is 32509983
```
